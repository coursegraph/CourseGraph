# Please setup the D3 prototype here

Whenever you start working on this, I want frequent commits and pushes so that I know what you're working on and can track your progress; ofc we can meet and work on this together in person as well.

What you should do: add a local HTML file (D3 is clientside only right?) and start working on that here. We'll integrate this with the backend later; for now this is just a clientside / local prototype.

Thanks,
â€“ Seiji
